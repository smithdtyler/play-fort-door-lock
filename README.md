Design for a Lock for the Door to My Kids' Fort

# Context
My kids, my father, and I together built a pretty cool fort. It is not complete yet, but it is enclosed and has a door. The problem, however, is that the door does not lock (or even latch!) 

## The Fort

The fort is elevated 4' off the ground. Structural designs for the fort are managed in (TODO: Create Project)

## The Door

In previous forts (see this [blog post](https://www.smithdtyler.com/2018/08/how-to-build-tree-fort.html)) I've used a screen-door type setup wtih a spring to pull the door closed. However, for this design I want to provide a little bit more security and weather-resistance. 

## Stakeholders

Me and my kids are the primary stakeholders. I am concerned about the safety of my kids and security of our property. 
My kids are concerned about having fun with the fort. 

# Engineering Approach

This project is a good excuse to learn some new technologies and to play around with model-based systems engineering tools on a soup-to-nuts project.
