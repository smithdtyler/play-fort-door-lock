# Goals

1. Learn to use [AGREE](https://github.com/loonwerks/AGREE)
2. Create a top-to-bottom MBSE specification of a real thing that I need, including
   1. Physical specification
   2. Specific products/parts
   3. Requirements Verification
   4. Code Generation

# Open Questions
- What requirements languages would be useful for writing requirements? Is it worth the effort versus going direct to formal modeling?
