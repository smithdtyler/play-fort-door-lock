# Informal Requirements for Door and Door Lock

1. will not allow a child to get stuck
1. can be closed/monitored against critters/teenagers
1. does not require physical keys

# Q&A Between Collaborators

## What does closed/monitored mean?
- Does the system need to close the door, or simply engage the lock?
  - TDS: I think just engage the lock. An actuator that could close the door introduces a whole new variety of safety risks. 
- Does monitored mean the state of the lock (e.g., locked/unlocked), or the inside of the fort for motion/presence of critters/teenagers?
  - TDS: Good question. Ideally both. 
- What size of critters are of interest?  Mice or raccoons?
  - Mice are going to be hard to keep out entirely, since they can fit through very small spaces. 
  - I'm planning to make this tight enough to keep our anything rat-size or larger. 
- Is a physical button, switch, or ability to actuate the lock from the inside acceptable to meet needs 1 and 3?
  - TDS: Yes. 


# Open Questions: 
- What requirements languges are would be useful for writing requirements? Is it worth the effort versus going direct to formal modeling?
